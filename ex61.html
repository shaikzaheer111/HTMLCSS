<!-- class selector : between the tag selector and id selector we have some gap that gap is managed by the 
class selector 

if we want to apply the styles as group wise then only we can go with class selector. for every group applying 
different style
ex:4 groups four different colours
group of tags also we can apply

Synatx: .class-name{
            prop:value;
			.....
          } 
		  
we can write multiple selectors...
mapping
     <tag class="class-name">
	 <tag class="class1 class2 class3...">
