	    <h2>Chat-gpt </h2>
		<p>ChatGPT is a chatbot and virtual assistant developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022.
		Based on large language models (LLMs),it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a 
		desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive user prompts and replies are
		considered at each conversation stage as context.[2]</p>
		
		<h3> History </h3>
		<p>Some scholars have expressed concern that ChatGPT's availability could reduce the originality of writing,
		cause people to write more like the AI as they are exposed to the model, and encourage an Anglocentric perspective
		centered on a few dialects of English globally.[166] A senior editor at The Atlantic wrote that ChatGPT and other 
		similar technology make the previously absurd idea of the dead internet theory a little more realistic, where AI 
		could someday create most web content in order to control society.[167]</p>
